# DeepSeek Harness Semgrep SAST

`@aaub-software/dsh-semgrep-sast` is a Cordis bundle that registers the
model-facing `semgrep_scan` tool in
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

The default managed runtime supports Windows x64 and includes CPython 3.14.7
and Semgrep 1.163.0. Users do not need to install Python or Semgrep separately.

## Install

DeepSeek Harness and Node.js 24 or newer are required. Install the bundle into
the profile you use, for example:

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add @aaub-software/dsh-semgrep-sast
```

Restart the profile after installation. The agent will then see the
`semgrep_scan` tool.

## Behavior and safety

- Scans only workspace-relative files and directories.
- Rejects paths and resolved symlinks that escape the active workspace.
- Defaults to Semgrep Registry `p/default`; supports opt-in bundled `cwe-audit` rules.
- Supports `focus_cwes`, `diversify`, `max_findings` (1..200 within the configured cap)
  and bounded `context_lines` (0..20) for source review. Defaults preserve prior behavior.
- Audit matches include guarded code. Verify input, reachability and effective controls
  before reporting; a scan match is a navigation candidate.
- Does not expose autofix and disables Semgrep metrics.
- Redirects Semgrep cache, settings, configuration, and logs to the temporary
  scan environment.
- Supports Harness cancellation, timeout, process-tree termination, bounded
  subprocess output, and bounded model-facing findings.
- Returns structured findings for contextual review; a rule match is not by
  itself a confirmed vulnerability.

## Model-facing result

Version 0.2 returns the public `ssc-sast/v1` contract from
`@aaub-software/dsh-sast-contract`. The Agent receives normalized JSON rather
than native Semgrep output:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "ssc-sast/v1",
  "status": "completed",
  "scanner": {
    "name": "semgrep",
    "version": "1.175.0",
    "configuration": "p/default"
  },
  "scannedPaths": ["src/server.js"],
  "findings": [],
  "diagnostics": [],
  "summary": {
    "totalFindings": 0,
    "returnedFindings": 0,
    "truncated": false,
    "durationMs": 125
  }
}
```

Each finding contains a stable ID, scanner attribution, normalized rule
metadata, an exact workspace-relative location, and bounded evidence. Semgrep
matched code and metavariables are exposed as `semgrep.matched-code` and
`semgrep.metavariables` evidence when present. CWE, OWASP, references, and
fingerprints are retained only when Semgrep emitted them; the adapter does not
guess missing metadata. Diagnostics remain separate from security findings so
an incomplete scan cannot be mistaken for a clean scan.

On Windows, Semgrep Core cannot open the system certificate store inside the
current Harness ACL sandbox. A restricted first call does not start the scan.
Instead, it returns the standard permission-escalation hint. The model may retry
the same scan with `sandbox_permissions: "danger-full-access"` and a concise
`justification`; Harness asks the user for approval before execution.

The default ruleset is obtained from the Semgrep Registry at scan time and may
require network access. Registry rules are not redistributed by this package.
